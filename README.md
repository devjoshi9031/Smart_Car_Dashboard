# Smart_Car_Dashboard
This repository contains the final code for my senior year undergraduate project. The aim of this system was to recognize the face of the driver and match it with the whitelist of people allowed to drive a particular car. Moreover, it also detects drowsy drivers and alert them if the system finds the driver to be drowsy. This feature has the potential to reduce the number of accidents in the USA by 20%.
